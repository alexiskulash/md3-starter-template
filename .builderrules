# Documentation

When making updates in this app be aware that a different LLM or developer will need to come and make updates to this app later. Always document your work by creating/updating the appropriate files in the .builder/rules directory.

To create/update a rules file for Builder's AI:

Create a .mdc file within the .builder/rules/ directory or update an existing one as appropriate. Provide a logical name for your file and provide the metadata as shown below:

# example of a .builder/rules/ file
# .builder/rules/component-structure.mdc
---
description: Component structure
globs:
alwaysApply: false
---
<add whatever documentation is needed>
############################
The following options are available as keys within the metadata header:
description: a brief description of the file's rules
globs: specific file paths where these rules should apply
alwaysApply: if set to true, the AI always applies these rules; otherwise, the AI contextually decides when to apply the rules (false should be default unless the rule should be global)

Builder's AI will not make any changes to your rule files.
